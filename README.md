# Real-time Paint Application using OpenCV

This Python script allows you to create a real-time paint application using OpenCV. Users can draw in real-time using different colors by leveraging the webcam as an input device. The script enables the user to select colors using a graphical interface and draw on a canvas on the screen.

## Installation

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python

markdown
Copy code

2. Run the script:
python your_script_name.py

css
Copy code

## Usage

- Run the script, and a window will open displaying the live webcam feed.
- Use the trackbars to select different upper and lower color ranges for detection.
- Use the color buttons to choose the color you want to draw with.
- Draw on the canvas using any object in the detected color range.
- Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- OpenCV
